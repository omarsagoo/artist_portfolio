Proposal:
create a webpage for artists to display their work.
pages can be added, deleted and updated.
lists all of the art pages on the main page.

other stuff:
made as a Django REST api so others can use it.
uses an outside api to add in trump quotes.(just because)
uses an an outside app (accounts) to handle users.

Heroku app: 
art-port-web.herokuapp.com

or clone and run $ python3 manage.py runserver

or visit 
art-port-web.herokuapp.com/api/artist to use the api
or
art-port-web.herokuapp.com/api/*id* to view a specific pages api
